# Assault

Assault is a custom-programmed Minecraft minigame centered around building, defending, and attacking team’s bases. Join
the server at **mc.thenathan.space**!

The premise of Assault is two opposing teams build defenses around their base, then take turns assaulting each other’s
bases. When the game starts, you’ll be assigned to one of two teams. The game takes place over two phases, the Building
phase and Attacking phase.
