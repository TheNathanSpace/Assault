## To-Do

### Bugs

- Bugs probably exist surrounding the FT5S mode, especially with ties
- `NullPointerException` with `GamePlayer` when leave and rejoin
- Citizens NPCs aren't deleted properly, so they stick around in Citizens' config

### Features

- `give_coin_delay` config option
- `give_coin_count` config option
- `gp_on_kill` config option
- Killing people gives flat coin bonus instead of 1/5 their coins?

- Package maps with plugin
- Add more game modifiers:
    - Most stars in 8 minutes
    - Swap team on death
