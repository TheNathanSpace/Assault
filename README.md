## To-Do

### Bugs

- Bugs probably exist surrounding the FT5S mode, especially with ties
- `NullPointerException` with `GamePlayer` when leave and rejoin
- Citizens NPCs aren't deleted properly, so they stick around in Citizens' config

### Features

- `gp_on_kill` config option
- Killing people gives flat coin bonus instead of 1/5 their coins?
- Coin cap
- Multiverse support
- Statistics (local database or simple json files)
- Package maps with plugin
- Add more game modifiers:
    - First to 5 stars
    - Most stars in 8 minutes
    - Swap team on death

- Actual documentation

## Roadmap

- Shops
    - Armor
    - Strength team buff?
    - Map-specific items
