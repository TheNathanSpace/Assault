## To-Do

### Bugs

- Bugs probably exist surrounding the FT5S mode, especially with ties
- can still get over wall barriers
- `NullPointerException` with `GamePlayer` when leave and rejoin
- Citizens NPCs aren't deleted properly, so they stick around in Citizens' config

- Multiverse support
- Allow different team color combinations
- Statistics (local database or simple json files)
- Package maps with plugin
- Add more game modifiers:
    - First to 5 stars
