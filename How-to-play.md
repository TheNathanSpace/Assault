# How to play!

When playing assault your objective is to defend your star and take your opponents.

## Building round

In the first round which lasts 3 minutes by default, you will have time to purchase blocks for defence using a pool of 100 coins. You then have to place a defence to protect your star against the enemy team.

## Attacking

When attacking you have 8 minutes (unless pre game an option was selected to have unlimited time) to capture the star. When doing so you spawn on the Northern side of the map and have to go to the defenders base and stand on the star, upon doing so you complete the round. You have an amount of coins which is going up constantly allowing you to purchase blocks, tools, & weapons. Emeralds also spawn in a predetermined location in the map which spawns emeralds every 20 seconds, when you have 4 emeralds you can purchase obsidian or TnT. You also get 'gamer points' for getting kills, you can then spend these on team wide buffs at the buff NPC. After a while you can toggle your vote to forfeit by running /forfeit. If a majority is reached your team will admit to losing.

## Defending

When defending you get a constant supply of money as is the attacker, and have access to emeralds too. Your objective however is to hinder or prevent the capture of the star, you can do this by PvP, placing blocks, or even playing mind games with them.

## Who Wins?
As of time of writing whoever collects the star in the least time wins, but other methods of victory may be planned.
